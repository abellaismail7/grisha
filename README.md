# Grisha
This project depends on this blog serie [Philipp Oppermann's blog](https://os.phil-opp.com/freestanding-rust-binary/)

# Required Knowlege
I don't know what you really need to know to learn efficiently from making a kernel, but here is what I think:

* These skills are required:
	* Rust essentials
	* Patient to read every char in an article

* These skills are not required whatsoever but might have huge impact on your learning proccess
	* C
	* Assembly
	* Basic knowledge of booting proccess
	* Basic knowledgw of how hardware interact with each other
	* Linux nerd
